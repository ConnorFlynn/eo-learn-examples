# AgriDataValue toolbox demonstrators

Within the [AgriDataValue](https://agridatavalue.eu) project, part of the federated capabilities come from the Sentinel Hub, eo-learn and eo-grow toolkit.

In this folder we show some examples how the toolbox can be used to perform tasks related to dealing with the data, indicators, using resources on Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and climate change monitoring and modelling.
