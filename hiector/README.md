# HIECTOR: HIErarchical object deteCTOR <img src="figs/hiector-logo.png" alt="hiector" width="300" align="right"/>

Repository to showcase the hierarchical building detection code available at [sentinel-hub/hiector](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/hiector). 

The code in the `HiectorInference.ipynb` notebook allows to execute building detection at large scale using multi-scale satellite imagery. In this example, Sentinel-2, Airbus SPOT and Airbus Pleiades imagery will be used to detect buildings in Dakar, Senegal.

Pre-trained models and labels are open-source and available on the AWS S3 bucket [queryplanet.sentinel-hub.com](http://queryplanet.sentinel-hub.com/index.html).
